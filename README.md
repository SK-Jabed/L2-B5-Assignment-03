# 📚 Library Management API

A **robust**, **scalable**, and **feature-rich** RESTful API for managing books and borrowings in a library system. Built with **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB** using **Mongoose**, this backend service offers seamless CRUD operations, real-time availability tracking, borrow management, and business-rule enforcement — making it ideal for educational institutions, digital libraries, and small-to-mid scale inventory systems.

## ❌ Error Handling Example

```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "name": "ValidationError",
    "errors": {
      "copies": {
        "message": "Copies must be a positive number",
        "name": "ValidatorError",
        "kind": "min",
        "path": "copies",
        "value": -5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📖 API Documentation

### 1. **Create Book**

`POST /api/books`

```json
{
  "title": "The Theory of Everything",
  "author": "Stephen Hawking",
  "genre": "SCIENCE",
  "isbn": "9780553380163",
  "description": "An overview of cosmology and black holes.",
  "copies": 5
}
```

---

### 2. **Get All Books**

`GET /api/books`

**Query Params**:

- `filter`: Genre filter (e.g., `FANTASY`)
- `sortBy`: Field name to sort by (`createdAt`, etc.)
- `sort`: `asc` or `desc`
- `limit`: Result limit (default: 10)

---

### 3. **Get Book by ID**

`GET /api/books/:bookId`

---

### 4. **Update Book**

`PUT /api/books/:bookId`

```json
{ "copies": 50 }
```

---

### 5. **Delete Book**

`DELETE /api/books/:bookId`

---

### 6. **Borrow a Book**

`POST /api/borrow`

{
  "book": "64ab3f9e2a4b5c6d7e8f9012",
  "quantity": 2,
  "dueDate": "2025-07-18T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

> ⚠️ Automatically reduces available copies and flags `available: false` if stock is 0.

---

### 7. **Borrowed Books Summary**

`GET /api/borrow`

**Returns** total borrowed quantity per book using aggregation.

---

## 🧠 Mongoose Features

- **Validation**: Ensures data integrity (e.g., non-negative copies)
- **Static Methods**: `Book.borrowCopies()` encapsulates borrow logic
- **Middleware**:

  - `pre-save`: Automatically sets availability
  - `post-save`: Custom hooks (e.g., logging)

---

## 🧪 Testing

You can test the endpoints with:

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
- [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.com/)
- `curl` or any HTTP client of your choice

---

## 🔐 Security

- Input validation prevents malformed data
- Environment variables prevent secret exposure
- Consider adding rate limiting and authentication in production

---

## 💸 Monetization Ideas

- **SaaS Subscription**: Offer a hosted dashboard for schools/libraries.
- **API as a Service**: Provide paid API access with usage limits.
- **Premium Tier**: Add advanced analytics, user auth, overdue fine tracking.
- **White-label Licensing**: Offer the app as a branded solution for institutions.
